The package Ringo facilitates the primary analysis of ChIP-chip data. The main functionalities of the package are data read-in, quality assessment, data visualisation and identification of genomic regions showing enrichment in ChIP-chip. The package has functions to deal with two-color oligonucleotide microarrays from NimbleGen used in ChIP-chip projects, but also contains more general functions for ChIP-chip data analysis, given that the data is supplied as RGList (raw)  or ExpressionSet (pre- processed). The package employs functions from various other packages of the Bioconductor project and provides additional ChIP-chip-specific and NimbleGen-specific functionalities.
