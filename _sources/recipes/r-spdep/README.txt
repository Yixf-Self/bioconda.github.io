A collection of functions to create spatial weights matrix objects from polygon contiguities, from point patterns by distance and tessellations, for summarizing these objects, and for permitting their use in spatial data analysis, including regional aggregation by minimum spanning tree; a collection of tests for spatial autocorrelation, including global Moran's I, APLE, Geary's C, Hubert/Mantel general cross product statistic, Empirical Bayes estimates and Assunção/Reis Index, Getis/Ord G and multicoloured join count statistics, local Moran's I and Getis/Ord G, saddlepoint approximations  and exact tests for global and local Moran's I; and functions for estimating spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) lag and error models, impact measures for lag models, weighted and unweighted SAR and CAR spatial regression models, semi-parametric and Moran eigenvector spatial filtering, GM SAR error models, and generalized spatial two stage least squares models.
